How do I create a basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) app? 
- FrontEnd: React to manipulate DOM, 
  - Make sure to look into prop drilling, and to update state whenever there are changes to make it fast. 
  - on Front End, program the buttons! 
- BackEnd: Using NodeJS + Express, we can handle the various routes coming our way from the front/client end. 
  - through middlewares, we'd be able to modularize our application, making it easier to scale up.
- hook up to mongoDB or SQL database
